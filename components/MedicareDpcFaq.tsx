            <strong>Yes!</strong> Your membership handles your 90%—day-to-day care, same-day sick visits, and complex chronic management with Dr. Pike (a Board-Certified Specialist). Medicare remains your 10% safety net for hospitalizations and major surgeries.

            <strong>As of Jan 1, 2026, Yes.</strong> Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), DPC fees are now 100% HSA-eligible. Since our Senior Tier is $109/mo (well under the $150 federal cap), you can use tax-free dollars to pay for your care, effectively saving you up to 30% depending on your tax bracket.

          <AccordionContent itemValue="item-3" className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            No. You should keep your Part D coverage for high-cost prescriptions. However, our members often save significantly by using our wholesale lab rates ($5-$18) rather than billing Medicare and dealing with deductibles.
