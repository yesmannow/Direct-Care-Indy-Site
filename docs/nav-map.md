## Route Changes
- /membership → /pricing (URL redirect needed if changing)
- /how-it-works → Move to footer or remove from header
- Keep all existing routes working

## Conversion Path Simplification
1. Visitor lands on Home
2. Sees clear call-to-action for Pricing
3. Can reach Join in 1 click from header
4. Services page clearly explains what's included/not included
5. No distracting nested menus or secondary paths in header
