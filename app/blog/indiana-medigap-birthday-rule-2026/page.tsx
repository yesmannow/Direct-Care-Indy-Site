                Starting January 1, 2026, Indiana seniors have a powerful new tool to reduce healthcare costs: the &quot;Medigap Birthday Rule&quot; (House Enrolled Act 1226). If you&apos;re 65 or older and your birthday falls in January, you&apos;re currently in a 60-day &quot;Guaranteed Issue&quot; window where you can switch Medicare Supplement plans without answering health questions.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">What is the Indiana Birthday Rule?</h2>
              <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
                The Birthday Rule allows Medicare beneficiaries to switch to a Medigap plan of equal or lesser coverage during their birthday month and the following 30 days—without medical underwriting. This means you can potentially save hundreds of dollars per year by switching to a lower-cost plan with the same coverage level.
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground mb-6">
                <strong>Key Point:</strong> The average Indianapolis senior pays $217/month for Medigap Plan G. During the Birthday Rule window, many can switch to a plan costing 15-25% less ($163-$185/month), saving approximately $400-$650 per year.
              </p>

              <p className="text-foreground mb-6">
                As of January 1, 2026, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) makes Direct Primary Care memberships HSA-eligible for the first time. This is a game-changer for Medicare beneficiaries who have existing HSA funds from previous employment or high-deductible health plans.

                Since Direct Care Indy&apos;s Senior Tier is $109/month—well under the $150 federal cap—you can use your HSA to pay for your membership with pre-tax dollars, effectively reducing your out-of-pocket cost by up to 30%.
