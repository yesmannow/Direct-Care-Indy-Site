## 📋 Linting & Code Quality

### Summary
- **Critical Errors:** 0 ✅
- **Accessibility Warnings:** 2 (pre-existing in Navbar hover interactions)
- **Linting Suggestions:** ~40 (cosmetic only - Tailwind class optimizations)
- **Markdown Warnings:** ~60 (documentation formatting only)

### Breakdown by Category

#### 1. Accessibility (Non-Breaking)
**Files Affected:** `components/Navbar.tsx`
**Issue:** Non-native interactive elements (hover divs)
**Impact:** Low - these are mega menu dropdowns on desktop only
**Action:** Optional enhancement - can be addressed post-launch

#### 2. Tailwind Class Suggestions (Cosmetic)
**Files Affected:**
- `components/MobileAppBar.tsx` - `min-w-[60px]` → `min-w-15` (4 instances)
- `app/globals.css` - `min-h-[44px]` → `min-h-11` (4 instances)
- `components/PWAInstallPrompt.tsx` - `flex-shrink-0` → `shrink-0` (1 instance)
- `components/HintHealthPortal.tsx` - Various modern class suggestions

**Impact:** Zero - purely cosmetic, no functional difference
**Action:** Optional cleanup - does not affect deployment

#### 3. ESLint Preferences (Cosmetic)
**Files Affected:** Multiple PWA components
**Issue:** Prefer `globalThis` over `window`
**Impact:** Zero - both work identically in browser
**Action:** Optional - can standardize post-launch

## 🎨 PWA Icon Requirements

### Current Status
**Icon files referenced in manifest:**
- `/images/logos/dci-icon-192.png` ❌ Missing
- `/images/logos/dci-icon-512.png` ❌ Missing

**Existing logo assets:**
- `dci logo primary.PNG` ✅ Available
- `dci logo secondary.PNG` ✅ Available
- `dci-logo-primary.svg` ✅ Available

### Action Required
You need to create two square PNG icons from your existing logos:

1. **dci-icon-192.png** (192×192 pixels)
   - Square format with transparent or white background
   - Should be readable at small sizes
   - Place in `/public/images/logos/`

2. **dci-icon-512.png** (512×512 pixels)
   - Same design as 192px version, just higher resolution
   - Place in `/public/images/logos/`

### Quick Creation Methods

**Option 1: Use Online Tool**
1. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or https://favicon.io/
2. Upload `dci-logo-primary.svg`
3. Download 192×192 and 512×512 versions
4. Rename to `dci-icon-192.png` and `dci-icon-512.png`
5. Place in `/public/images/logos/`

**Option 2: Use Image Editor**
1. Open `dci-logo-primary.svg` in Photoshop/GIMP/Figma
2. Export as PNG:
   - First at 192×192px
   - Then at 512×512px
3. Save with proper names in `/public/images/logos/`

**Option 3: Use PowerShell (if ImageMagick installed)**
```powershell
# Convert existing PNG to required sizes
magick "public/images/logos/dci logo primary.PNG" -resize 192x192 public/images/logos/dci-icon-192.png
magick "public/images/logos/dci logo primary.PNG" -resize 512x512 public/images/logos/dci-icon-512.png
```

### Impact of Missing Icons
**Without Icons:**
- ✅ PWA still works and can be installed
- ✅ All functionality remains intact
- ❌ Generic browser icon shows on home screen
- ❌ Less professional appearance

**With Icons:**
- ✅ Your logo appears on home screen
- ✅ Professional branded app experience
- ✅ Higher install conversion rate

**Recommendation:** Create icons before deployment for best user experience, but site can deploy without them.

## 🌐 Environment Variables Audit

### Local Environment
**File:** `.env.local` ✅ Exists
**Status:** Configured for local development

### Required for Vercel Production

# OR Option 2: Resend API
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here

# OR Option 3: SendGrid API
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here

#### Optional Variables
```bash
# Air quality widget for Indy Breath-Easy component
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=ea2669bff97a26ccf6139c285f183f46
```

### How to Add to Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**

## 🐛 Known Non-Critical Issues

### 1. Accessibility Warnings (2)
**File:** `components/Navbar.tsx`
**Issue:** Hover div interactions in mega menus
**Impact:** Low - desktop-only, mouse interactions work fine
**Fix:** Optional - add keyboard navigation support

### 2. Tailwind Class Suggestions (40+)
**Multiple Files**
**Issue:** Can use shorter class names (e.g., `min-w-15` vs `min-w-[60px]`)
**Impact:** Zero functional impact
**Fix:** Optional cleanup - cosmetic only

### 3. ESLint Preferences
**Multiple Files**
**Issue:** Prefer `globalThis` over `window`
**Impact:** Zero - both work identically
**Fix:** Optional standardization

### 4. Markdown Linting
**Documentation Files**
**Issue:** Formatting preferences (blank lines around headings)
**Impact:** Zero - doesn't affect site functionality
**Fix:** Optional - docs work perfectly as-is

**None of these issues affect deployment or functionality!**
